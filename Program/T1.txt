# What is Artificial Intelligence?

## Understanding Artificial Intelligence
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: A broad branch of computer science.
- **Goal of AI**: To create systems that can function intelligently and independently.
- Often conceptualized in the context of human intelligence, as humans are the most intelligent creatures known.

## AI Fields Mimicking Human Abilities
- **Speech Recognition**: AI field focused on enabling machines to understand spoken language.
  - Much of it is statistically based, often referred to as **Statistical Learning**.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: AI field enabling machines to read, understand, and generate human language (text).
- **Computer Vision**: AI field that allows machines to see, process, and understand visual information from the world (e.g., images, videos).
  - Traditionally falls under the *symbolic* way for computers to process information.
- **Image Processing**: A field required for computer vision, dealing with the manipulation and analysis of images created by sensors (like eyes).
  - While not directly AI, it's foundational for computer vision tasks.
- **Robotics**: AI field concerned with enabling machines to understand their environment and move around fluidly.
- **Pattern Recognition**: AI field focused on identifying patterns and regularities in data (e.g., grouping like objects).
  - Machines excel at this due to their ability to process vast amounts of data across many dimensions.
- **Machine Learning**: A subfield of AI and pattern recognition where machines learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions.

## The Brain-Inspired Approach: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- **Neural Networks**: AI models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, aiming to replicate cognitive capabilities.
  - Composed of interconnected "neurons" that learn from data.
- **Deep Learning**: A subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers ("deep" networks) to learn complex patterns from data.
  - Represents different techniques to replicate human brain functions.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A type of deep learning network effective at processing grid-like data, such as images.
  - Scans images (e.g., left to right, top to bottom) to recognize objects in a scene, essential for computer vision and object recognition.
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: A type of deep learning network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, allowing it to remember limited past information (e.g., context in a sentence).

## Core Paradigms of AI
AI fundamentally works in two ways:
1.  **Symbolic-based AI**: Focuses on explicit rules and representations of knowledge (e.g., expert systems, some computer vision).
2.  **Database-based AI (Machine Learning)**: Relies on feeding machines large datasets to learn patterns.
    - Machines can learn patterns in hundreds or thousands of dimensions, surpassing human capabilities for high-dimensional data analysis.
    - Once patterns are learned, machines can make predictions that humans cannot.

## Applications of Machine Learning
Machine learning techniques are primarily used for two tasks:
-   **Classification**: Assigning data points into predefined groups or categories.
    - *Example*: Assigning new customers to a group like "young adults" based on their information.
-   **Prediction**: Forecasting future outcomes or values based on learned patterns from past data.
    - *Example*: Predicting if a customer is likely to switch to a competitor.

## Types of Machine Learning Algorithms
Learning algorithms in AI are categorized by how they are trained:
-   **Supervised Learning**: Training an algorithm with data where both the input and the correct "answer" (output) are provided.
    - *Example*: Training a machine to recognize friends by name, where you explicitly label each friend for the computer.
-   **Unsupervised Learning**: Training an algorithm with data where the machine needs to discover patterns or structures on its own, without explicit answers.
    - *Example*: Feeding data about celestial objects and expecting the machine to identify natural groupings or patterns within the data.
-   **Reinforcement Learning**: Training an algorithm by setting a goal and allowing the machine to learn through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.
    - *Example*: A robot attempting to climb a wall, learning the successful steps through repeated attempts.

## Key Concepts

-   **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A specialized deep learning architecture particularly effective for processing visual data, such as images, by detecting features in various regions.
-   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: A type of neural network designed to process sequential data, allowing it to maintain an internal state or "memory" of previous inputs, suitable for tasks like natural language processing.
-   **Symbolic AI**: An approach to AI based on representing knowledge in symbols and manipulating these symbols using logical rules.
-   **Classification**: A machine learning task of categorizing data into predefined classes or groups.
-   **Prediction**: A machine learning task of forecasting a future outcome or value based on past data.
-   **Supervised Learning**: A machine learning paradigm where the model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs).
-   **Unsupervised Learning**: A machine learning paradigm where the model finds patterns or structures in unlabeled data without explicit guidance.
-   **Reinforcement Learning**: A machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward, often through trial and error.
